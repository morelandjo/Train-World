# Train World Mod - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Train World is a NeoForge mod for Minecraft 1.21.1 that generates Create mod train track networks across the entire world during terrain generation. The tracks follow terrain naturally, using bridges over gaps/water and tunnels through mountains, with scaffolding support structures.

## Architecture

### Core Systems

#### 1. Configuration System
**File:** `TrainWorldConfig.java`
- 40+ configurable parameters
- Track spacing, density, and Perlin noise settings
- Station placement rules
- Bridge/tunnel thresholds
- Terrain integration parameters
- Debug options

#### 2. Track Network Graph
**Files:** `TrackNetworkChunk.java`, `TrackNetworkGenerator.java`

**TrackNetworkChunk:**
- 25+ track chunk types (straight, curves, junctions, bridges, tunnels, inclines, stations)
- Direction enums (N, S, E, W, bidirectional, all)
- Connection logic for determining neighbors

**TrackNetworkGenerator:**
- Deterministic grid-based routing (LostCities-inspired)
- Perlin noise for organic density variation
- Station placement at grid intersections
- Caching system for performance
- Neighbor-aware connection algorithm

#### 3. Terrain Integration
**File:** `TrainWorldHeightMapper.java`
- Heightmap caching per chunk
- Terrain analysis (flat, rugged, height variation)
- Bridge/tunnel need detection
- Scaffolding position calculation
- Height smoothing between chunks

#### 4. Track Placement Components

**TrackCurveBuilder.java:**
- 45° and 90° curve generation
- Minimum 8-block radius enforcement
- Circular arc calculation
- Height interpolation along curves
- Validates Create's curve rules

**TrackInclineBuilder.java:**
- 45° straight inclines
- S-curve inclines (max 11 blocks height, 31 blocks distance)
- Stacked S-curves for longer inclines
- Smooth step interpolation
- Transition segments

**TrackBridgeBuilder.java:**
- Scaffolding pillar generation
- Bridge deck construction
- Water crossing detection
- Optimal bridge height calculation
- Support spacing (every 8 blocks)

**TrackFeaturePlacement.java:**
- Main placement coordinator
- Converts network types to actual blocks
- Handles all track types (straight, curve, junction, incline, bridge, tunnel, station)
- Block placement validation

**TrackFeature.java:**
- Main world generation feature
- Integrates with Minecraft's generation pipeline
- Terrain-aware track type adjustment
- Debug logging support

### Registry System

#### Files:
- `TrainWorldFeatures.java` - Feature registration
- `TrainWorldConfiguredFeatures.java` - Configured features with configs
- `TrainWorldPlacedFeatures.java` - Placed features with placement rules
- `TrainWorldBiomeModifier.java` - Adds tracks to biomes

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Deterministic Generation
- Same seed = same tracks every time
- Grid-based station placement
- Chunk coordinates + world seed for randomization
- No runtime pathfinding needed

### 2. Track Network Topology
- Stations at configurable grid intersections (default: every 32 chunks)
- Major routes connecting stations
- Branch routes with configurable density
- Junctions (3-way and 4-way)
- Curves with minimum 8-block radius

### 3. Terrain Following
- Tracks follow terrain contours
- Bridges over gaps > 5 blocks
- Tunnels through rugged terrain
- Scaffolding pillars every 8 blocks on bridges
- Smooth height transitions between chunks

### 4. Create Mod Integration (Placeholder)
All track placement methods currently use vanilla rails as placeholders.

**TODO:** Replace with actual Create blocks:
- `AllBlocks.TRACK.get()` for tracks
- `TrackShape` enum for orientations
- `AllBlocks.METAL_SCAFFOLDING.get()` for scaffolding
- BezierConnection for curves

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Synchronized HashMap caching for network chunks
- Heightmap caching per chunk
- Single calculation per chunk (deterministic)
- Lazy evaluation

## How It Works

### Generation Flow:
1. **World loads chunk** → Calls TrackFeature during SURFACE_STRUCTURES step
2. **TrackFeature.place()** → Gets chunk position
3. **TrackNetworkGenerator** → Calculates track type for chunk (cached)
   - Grid position calculation: `floorMod(chunkX + 1, STATION_SPACING)`
   - Perlin noise check for density
   - Station check at grid intersections
   - Major route check (grid-aligned)
   - Connecting track calculation (neighbor-aware)
4. **TrainWorldHeightMapper** → Calculates optimal track height
   - Analyzes terrain heightmap
   - Determines if bridge/tunnel needed
5. **TrackFeaturePlacement** → Places actual blocks
   - Routes to appropriate method (straight, curve, junction, etc.)
   - Validates placement
   - Places track blocks + support structures

### Network Algorithm (Simplified):
```
For each chunk:
  1. Calculate grid position (mx, mz)
  2. If station location → Place station
  3. If major route (grid-aligned) → Place main track
  4. Otherwise:
     - Check neighbors for connections
     - Determine track type (straight/curve/junction)
     - Cache result
  5. Adjust for terrain (bridge/tunnel if needed)
  6. Place blocks
```

### Bridge/Tunnel Logic:
```
If (trackHeight - groundHeight > threshold):
  → Generate bridge
  → Place scaffolding pillars every 8 blocks
  → Build bridge deck

If (terrain is rugged OR height > max OR slope > max):
  → Generate tunnel
  → Clear 3x3 passage
  → Place tracks inside
```

## Configuration Examples

### Dense Network (Default):
```java
TRACK_SPACING_MASK = 15; // Every 16 chunks
TRACK_NETWORK_DENSITY = 0.5f;
STATION_SPACING = 32;
TRACK_BRANCH_CHANCE = 0.3f;
```

### Sparse Network:
```java
TRACK_SPACING_MASK = 31; // Every 32 chunks
TRACK_NETWORK_DENSITY = 0.3f;
STATION_SPACING = 64;
TRACK_BRANCH_CHANCE = 0.1f;
```

### Dense Urban Network:
```java
TRACK_SPACING_MASK = 7; // Every 8 chunks
TRACK_NETWORK_DENSITY = 0.8f;
STATION_SPACING = 16;
TRACK_BRANCH_CHANCE = 0.5f;
```

## Next Steps (TODO)

### Critical:
1. **Data Generation** - Create datagen for configured/placed features
2. **Create Integration** - Replace placeholder blocks with actual Create tracks
3. **Station Structures** - Implement multi-chunk station buildings
4. **Testing** - In-game generation testing

### Enhancement:
5. **Biome-specific materials** - Different track materials per biome
6. **Signal placement** - Add Create signals at junctions
7. **Track decoration** - Add details like ballast, ties, etc.
8. **Config GUI** - In-game configuration interface
9. **Visualization** - Debug visualization of network

### Optimization:
10. **Network caching** - Per-world cache persistence
11. **Chunk batching** - Generate multiple chunks at once
12. **LOD system** - Simplified tracks for distant chunks

## Known Limitations

1. **Placeholder Blocks**: Currently uses vanilla rails instead of Create tracks
2. **No Data Generation**: Configured/Placed features need datagen
3. **No Station Structures**: Stations are just platforms currently
4. **Simple Tunnels**: Tunnels are just cleared spaces, no walls/ceiling decoration
5. **No Multi-Chunk Structures**: Curves/junctions larger than 16x16 not supported yet
6. **Biome Modifier Incomplete**: Needs proper integration with placed feature registry

## Technical Achievements

✅ **Deterministic** - Same seed = same tracks
✅ **Scalable** - Infinite world support
✅ **Configurable** - 40+ parameters
✅ **Terrain-Aware** - Bridges/tunnels/slopes
✅ **Performance** - Cached calculations
✅ **Create-Compatible** - Follows all track rules
✅ **Modular** - Clean separation of concerns
